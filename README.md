# Tic Tac Toe Coding Challenge in Ruby

I was given a coding challene to improve the tic tac toe game by adding a few new features which are:

* Allow user to choose which player goes first
* Allow user to choose how each player marks the board
* Messages/notifying the user of selection
* Lessing the dependency on the command line (create a gem?).

### Confidence level
3.5/10, the .5 only because I have a really vague idea on how to create a gem and made a UI for an address book...but that a command line app. I'll try making it a gem. Pray for me everyone.
